# UPM-DataAnalysis

## Scope

The scope of the project is to analyse colonoscopy data, and identify the most influential variables. Moreover, the scope is also to solve the classification task of predicting the relevant and not relevant frames. We aim to aid the experts to achieve a more precise analysis of a colonoscopy video, by highlighting blocks which would prove more relevant to the diagnosis.

The project also aims to deploy the model which was evaluated the most fitting, in a system, which domain experts (such as doctors) can easily use. This deployed system would also provide interactive visualizations of the data and any other relevant information.
